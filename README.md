linear-based computer model uncertainty analyses

What is pyemu?
================

pyemu is a set of python modules for uesr-friendly linear-based computer model uncertainty analysis.  pyemu is closely linked to the open-source suite PEST (Doherty 2010a and 2010b, and Doherty and other, 2010) and PEST++ (Welter and other, 2012), which are tools for model-independent parameter estimation.  Several equations are implemented, including Schur's complement for conditional uncertainty propagation (the foundation of the PREDUNC suite from PEST) and error variance analysis (the foundation of the PREDVAR suite of PEST).

Examples
========

Two example ipython notebooks are used to demostrate the use of Schur's complement for uncertainty and data worth analysis and the use of error variance analysis to help design parameterizations that minimize the predictive bias generated by model error.  Both examples use a synthetic SEAWAT (Langevin and others, 2007)  model with 601 parameters that is based on the Henry  saltwater intrusion problem (Henry, 1964).

How to get started with pyemu
=============================

I recommend the Anaconda scientific python distribution (FREE!), which includes the dependencies for pyemu, as well as the ipython notebook:

[https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/])

Once installed, clone (or download) the pyemu repository and run the setup.py script from the command prompt:

`>>>python setup.py install`

Then start the ipython notebook from the command prompt:

`>>>ipython notebook`

You should then be able to view the example notebooks.
